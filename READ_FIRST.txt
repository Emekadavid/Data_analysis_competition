Because the files in the data analysis were related (e.g image files), 
I decided to zip all the files together. Please, I hope you don't mind. 

The notebook that would be used for presentation if I come out at top
20 is hackathon.ipynb. When you extract the files and open it, you 
will see the detailed analysis I carried out on the data sets 
based on the time constraint I faced. 

Thank you.
