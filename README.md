## Problem Statement

Is Africa really facing a health crises? The African news scene is abounding with talk of medical tourism and the brain drain of skilled medical personnel. But what does the data say about the subject?

After a detailed data analysis on a data set provided by 10Alytics and Mustard Insights, two entrepreneurial companies on the Nigerian data scene, it was realized that African governments have to take proactive action to address the above issues. They also need to emphasis on providing health infrastructure, improving medical personnel compensation, and prioritize the health sector in their yearly budgets. 

The analysis that was carried out in the above-mentioned datasets which you can find in the folders in this repo also proffers recommendations from the insights gained after analysing the data. 

## Questions Answered By The Data Analysis

This data analysis set out to answer 4 questions about the data and their relation to the health situation in Africa:

1. What are the major causes of death in the African continent?
2. What age bracket has the highest number of deaths?
3. Do we have sufficient medical doctors in Africa?
4. Are African governments adequately funding the health sector?

## Exploratory Data Analysis

For the EDA and other data wrangling tasks, consult the file `hackathon.ipynb`. 

## Insights 

1. It was discovered that the 5 major causes of death in Africa are Cardiobvascular diseases (the highest cause of death), HIV/AIDS, Malaria, diarrheal diseases, and lower respiratory infections. These diseases are related to economies with low income and low standard of living. Cardiovascular diseases also are the major cause of death in North American continent. For Africa to better combat these scourge, they have to learn from teh developed world. 

It is sad that HIV/AIDS, which can be well managed with drugs, is killing a lot of Africans. These testifies to the low standard of healthcare in Africa. 

2. A trend was seen as to the incidence of the 5 leading causes of death in Africa. While all the other diseases are showing a decline over the years 2013 to 2019, cardiovascular diseases are steeply increasing over the same period.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for African governments and citizens to invest in standard medical equipment and health education of the populace. 

3. There is a positive linear relationship between population and cardiovascular diseases casualty. This was seen from the data. But in the data, Egypt was an outlier for the African continent. While it's population was below that of Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa, the casualties for this disease in Egypt was significantly higher than that of Nigeria. These shows that other factors apart from population like socioeconomic factors are at play. 

4. Deaths by Age group bracket analysis shows that infants below the age of 5 and young people between the age of 15 and 49 years shows the highest number of annual deaths in Africa. In developed continents like North America, senior citizens or old people had the higher number of deaths. This situation is very sad. Africa is losing a lot of its youthful population to the cruel hands of death because of the crises in the health sector. These young people could have contributed to the economic growth and development of the continent. 

5. Another insight that was seen was that Africa has a sufficient number of doctors. The doctor to population ratio is 1 to 2 persons. Despite these high number of doctors (more than 400 million in 2018), there are more deaths in the population. These shows something is wrong somewhere. Either the doctors are not well trained or they don't have the equipment they need to practise standard medicine. 

Notably, there are lots of instances where hospitals in the rural areas in Africa do not have power to run their operations. 

6. Lastly, African governments are not prioritizing healthcare in Africa. The percentage of GDP that they budget to fund the healthcare system in their countries are very low. While countries like United States of America, Japan, and Germany spend more than 15 percent of their annual GDP on healthcare and health infrasture, the highest spender on health, South Africa, spends less than 9 percent of its annual GDP on healthcare. 

We have a lot to do in Africa to reverse the trend of falling health systems and the crises in healthcare. 

## Recommendations

1. African governments should prioritize health systems in their budgets. 
2. They should adequately train medical personnel and not just churn out medical graduates every year. 
3. Compensation of medical personnel should be at par with the rest of the world otherwise they will continue to leave for greener pastures. 
4. Health infrastructures should be well developed to improve the health status of the citizens and prevent much unncessary death from curable diseases. 

## Gratitude

These analysis was done as part of the 10Alytics Hackathon 2022 that was carried out online on December 3-4, 2022. It was organized by 10Alytics and Mustard Insights in Nigeria. I give much thanks to them for giving me the opportunity to participate in the hackathon. 

During the hackathon, I was 16th from 1800 participants spread across different countries in Africa. So glad about it. 

I hope you enjoyed the analysis.
